Language Chain Parse Script
================================

This script is part of the Language Chain project and is used to create a vector database from PDF, markdown, and text files.

Features
Loads data from PDF, markdown, and text files in the data/ directory
Splits loaded documents into chunks using recursive character-based text splitting
Transforms chunked documents into embeddings using Ollama Embeddings (mistral model)
Persists embeddings into a Chroma vector database
Allows for querying of the vector database using similarity search
Usage
To run this script, simply execute it using Python:

python parse.py
This will create a new vector database in the db/ directory and persist the embeddings.

Parameters
None. The script uses default parameters for loading data and creating the vector database.

Limitations
This script assumes that the input files are located in the data/ directory.
The script may take some time to run, depending on the size of the input files.
The script does not support querying the vector database at this time. This feature is planned for a future update.
